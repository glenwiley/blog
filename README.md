Glen Wiley simple blog

This is my personal blog site built using system tools and hand edited
html/css.  Feel free to copy it if you want a really simple way to
run your own peronsal blog.  Be aware though that it is very spartan,
no support for multiple authors (that is what unix user id's are for),
reader comments or other frills.

Todo
* generate category lists from post file names and populate menus
* create tagline
